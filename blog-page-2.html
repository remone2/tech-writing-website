        <h2>Weak and strong passwords</h2>
        <p>It’s important to have passwords that are difficult to figure out. Passwords are used to keep your important information
        safe from anyone. Two types of passwords are: a weak password and a strong password. A weak password is the same as
        having no password. An example would be, “bluemustang”. This is a password you don’t want to use because it only
        includes lowercase letters. People or programs could easily guess the password and have access to your accounts. A
        strong password will be difficult to guess. An example would be, “7rrTy2ui@”. This password looks random and is hard to
        decipher. Avoiding weak passwords and using strong passwords will prevent your accounts and information from being
        hacked.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Creating strong and multiple passwords</h2>
        <p>A Strong password should include these multiple requirements. It should have: a long string of characters, the use of
        numbers, the use of special characters, and capitalization.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A long password is generally 8 characters or more. (Muhlenberg College) Having a shorter password increases the chances
          of your password being found out.</li>
          <li>Numbers can be added at the start or end of your password, but having the numbers mixed in between the letters is
          better. Any amount of numbers will work.</li>
          <li>At least 1 special character should be added to your password. (Muhlenberg College) Examples of special characters are:
          “%”, “!” and “$”. These should also be mixed in between your letters and numbers.</li>
          <li>The keyboard has 26 options for letters, but is doubled with capitalization. Capitalizing the first letter in your
          password is not recommended. Instead, capitalize multiple and random letters throughout your password.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do not use the same password for multiple websites. If your one password is discovered from one website, it can be used
        to hack your accounts on other websites. Multiple passwords avoids this problem.</p>

        <h2>Keeping passwords safe</h2>
        <p>Passwords can be hard to remember. Especially when you have to keep multiple passwords for multiple websites. One
        solution is having a password manager. Some password managers to use are: Keeper, DashLane, LastPass and bitwarden.
        (PCMag) Most of them have prices, but there are some free ones. A free password manager that does not use technology is
        writing it down in a notepad or sticky note. Keep your notepad or sticky note hidden so other people will not be able to
        see it.</p>
