        <p>Have you ever wondered how websites are made? HTML and CSS are coding languages that are used to make websites. Both
        HTML and CSS help users navigate through the internet with ease</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What makes up HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML is an abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language. The “HyperText” is what links websites together through clicking
        on text or links. The “Markup” is how pages are shown by use of images or sections of text. HTML is made up of elements,
        tags and attributes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>An HTML element includes the HTML tag and the content inside. An HTML tag is used to group or transform text to do
        almost anything. A “section tag” can group text together, and that text can be inside a “p tag” which has a default font
        size and font weight. HTML tags can include HTML attributes to provide additional information. The “href” attribute is
        attached to an “a tag” to make the text inside the “a tag” be clickable to go to a website. An example on how the HTML
        element, tag and attribute work together is:</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/blog-3-img-1.png" alt="a section tag wrapping an a tag that links to google.ca">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>HTML elements can be either block or inline. A block element will have text be on a new line while an inline element
        will have text be on the same line. Text is normally inline when it is inside the same element. Text will be block when
        it is in different elements. An example would look like:</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/blog-3-img-2.png" alt="a section tag wrapping 3 p tags with a bunch of text">
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What makes up CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS is Cascading Style Sheets and it helps style and design the look of websites. CSS has to be linked to HTML for it to
        work. Without CSS, a website is just plain text and images on a white background. CSS is made of syntax rule, selector,
        property and value.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The CSS rule contains the CSS selector and CSS value. The CSS selector is used to identify the HTML tag, like the “p
        tag”, and target it. The CSS value and property is what you want to do to the content inside the tag. An Example is of
        what it looks like is:</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="./images/blog-3-img-3.png" alt="a p tag with its declared properties">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The p tag is targeted, and the text inside of it is changed to a font size of 14 pixels and the text color is changed to
        blue.</p>
        <br>
        <p>HTML and CSS can be used to make any websites look any way you want. Coding for these languages is easily accessible
        since all you need is Notepad, which comes pre-installed on your computer. However, VSCode is a preferred program since
        it provides many tools and shortcuts to help with coding faster and easier.</p>
