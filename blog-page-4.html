        <p>Shooting in Valorant is drastically different than normal FPS (First Person Shooting) games. For example, you cannot
        move and shoot, but instead have to stand still and shoot. This guide will teach you about Valorant gunplay, how to
        properly use the guns.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Aiming and Movement</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Aiming at Head Level</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Aiming is very important to winning a game of Valorant. Shooting an enemy's head does more damage than shooting their
        body or legs. That means it takes less time and bullets to kill an enemy if you aim at their head. A common tip that
        players like to use is to "Aim head level".</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>No Moving</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Do not move while you shoot. Moving while shooting increases the spread of the weapon meaning that it wil be less
        accurate. If you stand still and shoot, the first bullet will be very accurate and be in the middle of your crosshair.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Spraying</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Uncontrolled Spray</h4>
        <p>The typical spray pattern for most of the guns goes in the shape of a "T". First it goes up, then right slightly then
        left, and repeats going right and left.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/blog-4-img-3.png" alt="a T pattern of bullet holes on a wall">
        <p><em>Not controlling your recoil</em></p>
        <br>
        <h4>Controlled Spray</h4>
        <p>Since spraying makes the bullets go in a "T" pattern, you would want to keep it controlled. When controlling your spray,
        it keeps your bullets in a small area. It is also good to note that the bullets will not be where the crosshair is. To
        control your spray, move your mouse down, then left slightly then right, and predict where to move after.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Bursting</h3>
        <br>
        <p>If you're inconsistent at hitting headshots, learning how to burst your weapon is the next best option. Each weapon has
        different spray patterns but the first 3-4 bullets or "burst" of fully automatic guns are relatively the same. To
        control the recoil of your gun, move your mouse down slightly for 1 second as you fire your weapon.</p>

        <h2>Types of Guns</h2>
        <p>Valorant has 6 types of guns with their own variations. They all vary in cost of credits and handle differently.</p>

        <br>
        <p>We will only discuss the important guns, since they are more relevant to the average player. Every gun is a viable
        option, however they are used less than these guns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Classic</li>
          <li>Phantom / Vandal</li>
          <li>Operator</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Classic</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Classic is the free pistol that every Agent starts the round off with. It has 2 ways to fire: the left click which
        fires 1 bullet and the right click which fires a spreadshot of 3 bullets. The pistol holds 12 bullets in a clip and 36
        bullets in reserve. Since the pistol is free, it's important to use and be good with because it is the best weapon if
        you don't want to spend credits (Eco Round). It's also great at both long and short range, where as the other pistols
        are specialized in either one or the other. At short to medium range, it will take 1 headshot and 2 bodyshots to kill.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/blog-4-img-5.png" alt="3 bullet holes spread out circled in blue and a small cluster of bullet holes circled in red">
        <p><em>The blue circle is the Classic right click and the red circle is the Classic left click</em></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Phantom / Vandal</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Vandal and Phantom are the 2 main guns that the average Valorant player uses. The reason is because of the damage
        for both at the head and body. It takes 150 damage to kill an enemy and a headshot from the Vandal does 160 damage while
        a headshot from the Phantom does 156 damage. However for the Phantom, if the range is 15 meters or more, then it does
        between 140-124 damage. When shooting at the body, it takes around 4-5 bullets to kill while the other weapons, with the
        exception of the Operator, will take around 6-12 bullets. Recalling "Aiming at head level" section, it's better if it
        takes less time and bullets to kill an enemy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Both guns are the same price, but have slight differences:</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Vandal</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>25 bullets in the clip</li>
          <li>kills at head at all ranges (0m to 50m)</li>
          <li>lower rate of fire</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Phantom</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>30 bullets in the clip</li>
          <li>kills at head at specific ranges (0m to 15m)</li>
          <li>does not kill at head at longer ranges (15m to 50m)</li>
          <li>higher rate of fire</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Operator</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Operator is considered the best gun in the game. It can kill at any range with 1 shot to the head or body. The
        sniper has 5 bullets in a clip with 10 bullets in reserve. Since the hitbox for the head is small, it is better to aim
        for the body since it's hitbox is bigger.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/blog-4-img-6.png" alt="looking through a sniper scope with an enemy in the center of the crosshair">
        <p><em>Aiming body level is better</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>The downsides to the operator are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>expensive</li>
          <li>if you miss, you are most likely dead</li>
          <li>if you die, the enemy team can take it for free</li>
          <li>hard to use at shorter range</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The important key points are: Aim at head level, do not move while you shoot, burst your shots while slightly pulling
        down your mouse, and the important guns are the Classic, the Vandal, the Phantom, and the Operator. By remembering
        these, you can become a great Valorant player.</p>
