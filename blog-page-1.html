        <p>You may have noticed that most websites have a lock icon next to the address bar. This lock ensures that the information
        you input into the website will be safe. The name for the lock was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and is now known
        as Transport Layer Security (TLS), its successor.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>What is SSL and TLS?</h2>
        <p>SSL was developed by Netscape in 1994. It was a protocol used to help secure the transfer of information between your
        computer and the server that the website is held on. It works by encrypting your information and only the website
        holding your information can decrypt it. After the protocol was upgraded 3 times, it got replaced by a better protocol.
        In 1999, TLS was made and had better measures against exploitation and vulnerabilities on websites. The current version
        of TLS is 1.3, defined in 2018.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Encryption and HTTPS</h2>
        <p>Encryption works by taking plain text or information and scrambling it so it's unreadable to a person or program trying
        to decipher it. Without encryption, your information will be stored as is. This means anyone who can access the website
        has your unscrambled information. Two types of encryption are: Symmetric and Asymmetric. Symmetric encryption has 1 key
        to encrypt and decrypt. Asymmetric encryption has a public key which: encrypts and verifies if the information has an
        authentic signature, and a private key which: decrypts and acts as an authentic signature.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and HTTPS is hypertext transfer protocol secure. When a website has
        “http://”, it will usually replace the lock icon with an X icon, signifying that your connection is not secure and your
        information is unscrambled. However, if a website has “https://”, it will accompany the lock icon, signifying that your
        information is secure and scrambled.</p>

        <h2>How trustworthy is SSL/TLS?</h2>
        <p>SSL is trustworthy, but not everything can be fully secure. Hackers will always be trying to decrypt your information.
        However, developers are also constantly upgrading and finding ways to make their encryption better. Websites with the
        lock icon are more secure than websites without a lock icon. To ensure a website is always secure, they have an SSL/TLS
        certificate that can be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The website then goes through regular audits to
        determine if it can still be trusted. Information such as your address, credit card number or passwords are important
        and should be encrypted with the help of SSL/TLS and its encryption system.</p>
