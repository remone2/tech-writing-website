        <p>Hello, my name is Jamodin Maliwanag. My ethnicity is Filipino but I was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
        Unfortunately, I cannot speak Tagalog very well but I’m able to understand a few words. I grew up living with my
        grandparents at their house, along with my parents. Later on, my parents and I ended up moving quite often, to either
        houses or apartments. I’m currently living with my parents and our dog Ryder. He’s a purebred Poodle and he’s 2 years
        old. The reason we named him Ryder is because he enjoys car rides.</p>

        <p>The reason I’ve enrolled in the Software Development program is because I’ve always had an interest in games ever since
        I was young. The first time I was introduced to video games was at the age of 5 and it was Pokemon Red for the GameBoy.
        I’d like to land a job in the game industry working for Riot Games or Ubisoft, but I’d also be fine with any company. I
        enjoy technology because of the many options it provides. If you don’t know how to get to a friend’s house, you can use
        Google Maps to provide you a route, along with how long it will take to get there. It’s also really convenient to be
        able to buy almost anything online from services such as Amazon or UberEats.</p>

        <p>One thing I’m most passionate about is gaming. Since I started playing games at a very young age, I’ve grown attached to
        them. There are many genres and types of games I’ve experienced and I’ve enjoyed most of what I played. Currently, my
        favourite games are Apex Legends and Osu. Some other hobbies I have are trying to learn instruments. Right now I’m
        practising the melodica and I would like to buy a piano to practise with as well. I still like to go biking from time to
        time and while I don't anymore, I enjoyed playing tennis and volleyball.</p>
